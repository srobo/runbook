## Review Process

We should aim to keep review as lightweight as possible, with a bias towards
getting content live over making it perfect.

We do however want to review the content which is contributed for two reasons:

* content that is substantially unclear or actually wrong will do more harm than
  a lack of documentation

* some of the content here covers sensitive topics such as safety measures at
  events or safeguarding; it is especially important that documentation of these
  areas is correct & clear, warranting more scrutiny

The following protocol (in line with how GitHub describe these terms) is
therefore proposed for review:

* _Approval_ responses mean "this change can merge as is" but may include
  additional suggestions. Contributors may reject these suggestions, but are
  expected to respond to them before merging if that is the case. Discussion of
  these suggestions may continue after the PR is merged.

* _Comment_ responses are non-blocking, but also not approval, typically to ask
  questions about the content or suggest improvements. Such responses may
  indicate a review only of some part of the content.

* _Request changes_: responses are blocking and indicate that changes are needed
  before content can be merged. The review should indicate, either in the
  summary comment or in the inline comments, which of the issues raised are
  blocking. Such responses should be rare.

In general reviewers are encouraged to bias in favour of merging unless they
feel that the change is particularly sensitive or would be a net negative to the
runbook.

### Practicalities of Review

* Please do choose reviewers when opening a PR, ideally by subject matter but if
  in doubt pick one of the maintainers (@PeterJCLaw or @RealOrangeOne) and they
  can redirect
* Please do use GitHub's tooling to ask for re-review after changes
* After review the contributor is typically responsible for performing the merge
  themselves. New contributors (who may not have write access) should ping one
  of the maintainers or reviewers to do this instead.
