# Infrastructure Operations

This page summarises the service level objectives of the Infrastructure Team.

In general the Infrastructure Team expect to be able to respond to any issues
within a couple of days and to have acted on any issues or requests within a
week. Where possible the team aims to respond much faster than this, however the
time frame outlined here reflects the volunteer nature of the team.

See [Requesting Infrastructure](./requesting-infrastructure.md) for an overview
of how to request infrastructure from the Infrastructure Team.

## On Call availability

It is expected that during some events within the competition calendar the
response time described above will be insufficient. To accommodate this, Teams
may request that the Infrastructure Team arrange for "on call" availability for
their event.

On call times can cover the duration of the event, plus a few hours either side,
with the exact details being agreed ahead of time. (For example at the
Competition, this would be likely to cover the time in the venue plus some
buffer but not overnight).

On call availability may be requested up to a month ahead of any event, though
the Infrastructure Team does not guarantee that it will always be able to
support every event.

To request on call availability for an event, please follow the same process as
for requesting any other infrastructure.
