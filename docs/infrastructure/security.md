## Multi Factor Authentication

[Multi-factor authentication][wikipedia-mfa] (MFA) offers improved
authentication when accessing online accounts by requiring that the user provide
stronger proof of their identity before accessing an account.

All volunteers are encouraged to make use of multi-factor authentication on all
platforms which support it. Volunteers in positions of responsibility are
strongly encouraged to do so and should discuss with the Infrastructure
Committee any cases where this is impractical.
