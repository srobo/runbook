# Offboarding Checklist

From time to time volunteers may decide that they would like to leave the
organisation to focus on other things. When this happens we should try to ensure
that anything they're responsible for is handed over to another volunteer.

This checklist aims to provide prompts for things which might need to be handed
over. When a volunteer leaves the organisation, it is the responsibility of
their teams' committees to each run through this checklist.

## The Volunteer

- Thank the volunteer for their support. While they may be leaving us, it's
  important they know that they're welcome back and we're grateful for the
  support they have given us in the past.

- Arrange for the volunteer to return any equipment which belongs to the
  charity.

- If possible, ask why they're leaving. This should be conversational to build
  understanding, it's not about trying to convince them to stay.

## Third Party Services

- Check [the list][list-third-party-services] of who is configured as the
  "owner" of each third party service that we use and transfer as needed.

- Check whether there are any other services which the volunteer manages
  directly (e.g: packages on PyPI, projects in ReadTheDocs) and either confirm
  that they're happy to continue maintaining those or transfer as needed.
