# Area Owners

In order to make sure that nothing falls through the cracks, and that work is
not unduly piled onto a single person, we have a system of area owners. Ideally
these area owners cover all parts of the programme. This list is not set in
stone, and we expect it to change over time.

It is wise to make sure that each area owner has a deputy, who can step in when
they are unavailable, and can at least be aware of what is going on in their
area.
