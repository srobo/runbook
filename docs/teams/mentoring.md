# Mentoring

Where possible we try to arrange that competitor teams receive a regular mentor.
As well as providing support and guidance to the team, this volunteer typically
becomes the competitors' main contact with Student Robotics.

For this role, mentors need good access to information which may be pertinent to
competitors and compliment the information we send directly to team leaders.

This page provides an overview of how we organise mentoring and is intended both
for potential mentors and a team coordinator looking to organise mentoring.

## What mentoring entails

It's important to convey to potential mentors that even a small amount of their
time can make a really big impact to the teams they're supporting.

While we do have teams whose team leader is well able to support their
development, many teams are supervised by adults with little or no engineering,
electronics or software expertise and the mentor thus provides valuable access
to knowledge and experience.

There are two main parts to mentoring:

_Guiding the team's thinking_:

: Helping the team work through a specific problem, perhaps by asking leading
questions or introducing concepts they may not have considered. We also have
[separate documentation][mentor-guidance] on how to ask those questions for
those who have not mentored before. This may include suggesting ways for the
team to think about a problem so that they better solve it themselves.
A regular mentor will also build rapport with the team and act as someone to
bounce ideas off that has context on the team's robot while also being outside
the team enough to provide a slightly different perspective.

_Helping solve specific issues_:

: If a team have a specific issue, either with their robot, code or kit, then an
in-person mentor is likely to be able to help the team resolve that issue much
faster than a remote mentor or a post in the forums. This is primarily because
the mentor is so much closer to the issue, greatly reducing the cycle time for
any information about the issue and potential fixes. However it does not mean
that the mentor needs to understand how to fix every issue they hit -- even
during a mentored session, more involved issues might be posted to the forums or
the mentor might post in Slack to ask questions from other volunteers. In this
regard the mentor may be a conduit to the fix for an issue rather than directly
solving it for the team.

### In person schedule

For a typical in person mentoring session the mentor might:

* Arrange the timings with the team leader (initially this will be handled by
  the SR teams coordinator as part of matching up mentors with teams)
* Arrive at the school/college/etc.
* Present themselves at reception, stating that they're a mentor from Student
  Robotics and giving the team leader's name (as well as their own)
* Be met by the team leader, who will guide them to where the team are
* Guide the team for an hour
* Leave
* Post in [#teams][slack#teams] in Slack a quick update on how the team is doing

### Remote/virtual schedule

For a typical remote mentoring session the mentor might:

* Arrange the timings & video-call link with the team leader (initially this
  will be handled by the SR teams coordinator as part of matching up mentors
  with teams)
* Join the video call
* Guide the team for an hour
* Leave
* Post in [#teams][slack#teams] in Slack a quick update on how the team is doing

<!-- TODO: should we include safeguarding information in this document? -->

## Information we gather from potential mentors

* Confirmation that they are over 18
* Name
* Email address
* Roughly how often could commit to mentor a team
* Time (of day, days of week) available to mentor a team
* What skills they possess that makes them a suitable mentor
* Previous SR experience

For mentors who would be visiting teams in person, we also need:

* Location (approximate)
* How far they are willing to travel to mentor

### Example recruitment emails

* [Mentoring and Game Design Opportunities][sr2017-mentoring-game-design] (SR2017)
* [Student Robotics January Update][sr2021-january-update] (SR2021)

[sr2021-january-update]: https://github.com/srobo/volunteer-emails/blob/master/SR2021/2021-01-23-mentors.md

## Information we provide to mentors

Aside from guidance on [how to encourage learners][mentor-guidance] and our
safeguarding requirements, we don't currently have any structured training for
mentors on technical topics, though we have in the past run mentor days.

Mentor days involved a one-day competition for the mentors, with volunteers
grouped into teams of mixed experience and using pre-built robot bases. They
provided a way for the mentors to learn about the kits by using them as well as
to get to know other volunteers.

## Information we gather from teams

* Team
* When (time of day, day of week) and how often they meet
* Where they meet

### Example emails

For SR2021 we sent several emails to teams at varying levels of activity, first
offering mentoring to those who seemed to be struggling more before offering to
everyone.

* [Would you like a mentor?](https://github.com/srobo/team-emails/blob/master/SR2021/2021-02-14-league-2-followup-inactive.md) (less active teams)
* [Preparing for league 3](https://github.com/srobo/team-emails/blob/master/SR2021/2021-02-14-league-2-followup.md)

## Organising mentoring

### Process

When organising mentoring you are encouraged to reach out to both teams and
potential mentors as early as possible. We haven't found that there's
substantial advantage in trying to gather information from one group first,
rather that because it takes a while for everyone to respond starting early and
following up (particularly with teams) several times tends to work better.

Typically you will have more teams who are interested in a mentor than mentors
available, so you likely want to wait until you have a good feel for which teams
would like mentors and the mentor availability you can begin assigning mentors
to teams. This allows you to make best use of mentor availability while reducing
the chances you need to swap mentors around later.

While doing this you're encouraged to reply to teams/mentors promptly to
acknowledge their request for a mentor/offer to be a mentor.

Once you've worked out which mentors match with which teams, you should email
the team leader introducing the mentor and helping to set up their attendance at
the first meeting. More experience mentors may be willing/able to handle this
introduction themselves, though for newer mentors an explicit introduction is
encouraged.

During the competition year, when mentoring is ongoing, you should keep in
contact with mentors to understand both how their teams are doing and how the
mentor is doing.

### Schema

In SR2021 information from teams and mentors were captured into a fresh
worksheet within the internal teams spreadsheet, with rows by team and columns
of:

* **TLA**
* **Want Mentor?** (primarily to disambiguate negative replies from lack of reply)
* **Where messaged** (typically email/Discord; for easy later reference)
* **Meeting time**
* **Platform**
* **Assigned** (the mentor assigned to the team)
* **Notes**

A later section in the same sheet contain mentor information with columns of:

* **Mentors** (name)
* **Assigned** (TLA)
* **Notes**
* **Availability**
