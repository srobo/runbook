# Kit

As part of Competition Programme, we loan the competing teams a kit which forms
the core of their robot. This section documents how we develop and handle the
kit, including:

* [Event Operations](./event-operations/README.md): 
* [Logistics](./logistics/README.md): getting kit to/form teams as well as tracking and storage
* [Hardware](./hardware/README.md): how to maintain, diagnose and fix our hardware
* [Software](./software/README.md) which runs on it
