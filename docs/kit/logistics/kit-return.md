# Kit Return

## At the competition

At the end of the competition, teams are asked to return their kits to reception. Appendix A.1 of the [rules](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules/) notes the list of items expected back, items on this list are not expected back, but it's fine for them to be. At reception, the contents of the RUB should be checked to ensure it contains at least all the items on this list. Ensure there is nothing else left in the RUB the team may want back.

The [Kit Contents Checklist](https://github.com/srobo/kit-coordination-documents/tree/master/kit-contents-checklist) should be used to ensure all the items are present and correct. 1 form should be used per team, and this form should be kept to prove the kit was returned correctly. Once completed, keep the form with its respective kit.

### Missing Items

If a kit is not complete, the [Missing Kit Form](https://github.com/srobo/kit-coordination-documents/tree/master/missing-kit-form) should be completed noting which items of kit have not been returned. After the competition, these forms are tabulated and the teams contacted to ensure the safe return of the items of kit.

[Example email for teams with outstanding single items of kit](https://github.com/srobo/team-emails/blob/master/SR2019/2019-05-28-single-item-kit-chase.md)

If the team cannot find the item of kit, a like-for-like replacement (or as close as possible) should be ordered and shipped to the address listed for [Kit Loan Extension](./kit-loan-extension.md).

## After the competition

Kits being returned after the competition, either because they didn't attend the competition, or because they had a [Kit Loan Extension](./kit-loan-extension.md) should follow the [Kit Loan Extension](./kit-loan-extension.md) instructions for returning the kit.
