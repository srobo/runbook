Welcome to our runbook. This aims to be a single source for all Student Robotics
internal documentation, including information for the [Competition Team][competition-team]
and [Kit Team][kit-team] as well as other activities.

## Content Guidance

The runbook aims to document all the Student Robotics specific information which
a volunteer might need. This includes the historic context for the way that
things are currently done, the reasons behind that approach, as well as the
instructions on how to do things.

In that regard, the runbook aims to be _descriptive_ rather than _prescriptive_.
We are always open to new ways to do things, though by recording the reasons
for our current approach we aim to avoid needing to rediscover that repeatedly.

For more detailed guidance for editors, please see our
[contribution guide](./contributing.md).

### Scope Limitations

The runbook aims to provide general information as far as our own specific
information goes, so that it can always be a starting point for understanding.
There are many cases where it should not contain the actual documentation:

* Information about Student Robotics' structure as a charity. This instead is
  documented by the trustees in the [ops manual][ops-manual].
* Detailed information about internal (or external) tooling. These instead live
  with the tooling so that the runbook is not coupled tightly to the
  development of that tooling.
  Note: the runbook _may_ contain guidance on our approach to using external
  tooling, or recipes for using tooling which are common to us but too specific
  for general documentation.

### Approach

The runbook aims to be organised around the things it documents, rather than the
organisational structure which may be responsible for that thing.
This is a deliberate change from the previous structure, which had lead to a
chicken-and-egg scenario of needing to know what something was and who was
responsible for it and where the docs for it were in order to find the
documentation for it.
It is hoped that this approach will make the documentation more approachable to
newcomers, for both reading and contributing.

It's worth noting that, as of early 2020, the runbook is still a way off
achieving this aim as it contains considerable left-over structure & content
from the previous documentation which it subsumed.

## Ownership

While the runbook contains documentation relevant to the activities of the
all SR teams, no one team owns it any more than any other
volunteer. Instead the runbook aims to be a collaborative venture by all
volunteers.

That said, it is expected that contributions to the runbook should seek input
from volunteers with experience in the relevant area as part of their review
process. In time, it is hoped that the runbook's review process will support
this directly, perhaps through the use of GitHub's [code owners][code-owners]
feature.
