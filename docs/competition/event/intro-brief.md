# Introductory Brief

The introductory and H&S briefer gives a ~10m talk at the beginning of the
competition regarding matters of importance, which at a high level are:

* Health and Safety
* How the competition operates

In that order.

Health & Safety should cover at least:

* Common sense (i.e., don't run everywhere)
* Use of tools
* Battery safety
* Robot safety checking

The competition intro talk should:

* Introduce tinker time
* Explain (and illustrate) the procedure for operating the robot in a match,
   from gate to gate.
   * Especially highlight that teams must insert the USB stick provided at the staging area  **before** turning on their robot at the beginning of the match.
* Lay down rules on who is allowed where
* Describe tinker time and make it clear how one books tinker time.
* Give a short overview of the game itself (more or less what is printed on the competition flyer).
