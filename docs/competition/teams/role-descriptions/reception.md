# Reception Volunteer

Reception staff control entry to the building and inform attendees that photos and videos are being taken. Each reception staffer has their own desk and chair.

Here is a flow chart summarising the details below:

![Reception Desk Flow](../diagrams/reception-desk-flow.svg)

We need to inform people that we are taking photos and videos, if they object to this we should double check they understand what they are objecting to. We are taking photos and videos that we will use to advertise ourselves. If they still object they should be given a red lanyard and told to wear them at all times, this is to ensure that we do not take photos of them. We should explain that it would be best for them to avoid the arena as we are also livestreaming.

At the start of the competition day, there will be four reception staffers
covering the entrance. Once the initial influx of people is complete, this
will reduce.

Throughout the competition, receptionists typically get a lot of questions by the public. Any member of the public should be allowed into the building but let them know photos and videos might be taken of them. If there are spares give them a booklet, and feel free to send them to the arena if they seem interested.

# Handling Team Arrivals
When a team first arrives or leaves, your role as reception is to log this and confiscate items on entry, see below:

* Team entry/exit recording
 	* You will have a sign-in/sign-out sheet for team supervisors to
record that their teams have arrived and when they leave you should get the team supervisor to sign the sheet.
* Removing batteries, chargers, and bags:
 	* When on-site, we handle battery charging and robot safety, this means we should take all of the following items from each team:
 		* 1 x Battery (Teams have 2 batteries, please take their most-bulgy one).
 		* 1 x Battery charger.
		* 1 x Battery charging bag.
		* 1 x Battery charging Power Supply Unit (PSU).
* Give each competitor a bag of swag

# Handling Team Departures

**On Sunday**: If a team tries to leave the competition early (before we have kit return people in place), please grab someone from Helpdesk to act as a kit return handler (see [kit return](../../../../kit/event-operations/kit-return/)).

# Handling Volunteer Arrivals
Volunteers will be turning up throughout the competition, it's important to make sure they do what is needed before entering:
- Strongly recommend that they wear a face covering.
- Ensure they have completely read the safeguarding policy (They should have done this beforehand).
- Ensure they sign in on the sign-in sheet.
- Send them to the Volunteer rest area to get a T-Shirt.

* Pens.
