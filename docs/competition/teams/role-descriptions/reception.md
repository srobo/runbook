# Reception Volunteer

Reception staff control entry to the building and validate people's Media Consent Forms (MCFs) and/or wristbands. Each reception staffer has their own desk and chair.

Here is a flow chart summarising the details below:

![Reception Desk Flow](../diagrams/reception-desk-flow.svg)

**Everyone** must complete a Media Consent Form, Under 16's must have this form completed by a parent or guardian. If they have signed a form, or if they bring a pre-signed form, give them a wristband and ensure you see them put it on. Also, give each competitor a competition leaflet.

If they refuse, we should double check they understand what they are refusing. Media consent means that we can take photos or videos with them in and use this media to advertise ourselves. We should explain that photos and videos are being taken around the event and that it would be best for them to avoid the arena as we are also livestreaming. If they still refuse media consent provide them with a red lanyard to wear **instead** of a wristband. Instruct them they must wear this lanyard at all times around the event. Remember to give them a booklet too.

At the start of the competition day, there will be four reception staffers
covering the entrance. Once the initial influx of people is complete, this
will reduce. Additionally, after the initial influx, receptionists
should allow people wearing SR wristbands to enter the building at will (they
should check that people walking in have one, or follow the procedure above).

Throughout the competition, receptionists typically get a lot of questions by the public. Any member of the public should be allowed into the building if they sign a Media Consent Form. Feel free to answer, give them a booklet, and send them to Helpdesk (let them sign in) if they seem interested.

# Handling Team Arrivals
When a team first arrives or leaves, your role as reception is to log this and confiscate items on entry, see below:

* Team entry/exit recording
 	* You will have a sign-in/sign-out sheet for team supervisors to
record that their teams have arrived and when they leave you should get the team supervisor to sign the sheet.
* Removing batteries, chargers, and bags:
 	* When on-site, we handle battery charging and robot safety, this means we should take all of the following items from each team:
 		* 1 x Battery (Teams have 2 batteries, please take their most-bulgy one).
 		* 1 x Battery charger.
		* 1 x Battery charging bag.
		* 1 x Battery charging Power Supply Unit (PSU).

# Handling Team Departures

**On Sunday**: If a team tries to leave the competition early (before we have kit return people in place), please grab someone from Helpdesk to act as a kit return handler (see [kit return](../../../../kit/event-operations/kit-return/)).

# Handling Volunteer Arrivals
Volunteers will be turning up throughout the competition, it's important to make sure they do what is needed before entering:
- Strongly recommend that they wear a face covering.
- Ensure they have filled out an MCF.
- Ensure they have completely read the safeguarding policy (They should have done this beforehand).
- Ensure they sign in on the sign-in sheet.
- Send them to the Volunteer rest area to get a T-Shirt.

## Required Items

You should have the following items present for your duties. If you do not, please let the competition event coordinator know as soon as possible.

* Spare Media Consent Forms (MCFs) to allow visitors to enter.
* Pens to fill in forms.
* Wristbands to give to entrants.
* Competitor booklets to give to teams.
