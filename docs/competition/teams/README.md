# Competition Team Coordinator Role Documentation

This is the documentation for the competition team coordinator role.

There are 5 subordinate roles at the event, each of which is described
in the following documents:

* [Crimper](./role-descriptions/crimper.md)
* [Door Guard](./role-descriptions/door-guard.md)
* [Kit Return](../team-support/kit-return.md)
* [Reception](./role-descriptions/reception.md)
* [Tinker Time](../team-support/tinker-time.md)

**Note: Typically the competition team coordinator role also includes ensuring teams have adequate orientation and information about the rules. A document covering this for the 2017 competition can be found [here](./process-docs/pit-rules.md).**
