# Competition Team Coordinator Role Documentation

This is the documentation for the competition team coordinator role.

There are 7 subordinate roles at the event, each of which is described
in the following documents:

* [Arrival Desk](./role-descriptions/arrival-desk)
* [Crimper](./role-descriptions/crimper)
* [Door Guard](./role-descriptions/door-guard)
* [Intro Briefer](./role-descriptions/intro-briefer)
* [Kit Return](./role-descriptions/kit-return)
* [Reception](./role-descriptions/reception)
* [Tinker](./role-descriptions/tinker)

**Note: Typically the competition team coordinator role also includes ensuring teams have adequate orientation and information about the rules. A document covering this for the 2017 competition can be found [here](./process-docs/orientation-and-pit-rules).**
