# Competition Team Coordinator Role Documentation

This is the documentation for the competition team coordinator role.

There are various subordinate roles at the event, each of which is described
in the following documents:

* [Kit Return](../team-support/kit-return.md)
* [Reception](./role-descriptions/reception.md)
* [Tinker Time](../team-support/tinker-time.md)

**Note: Typically the competition team coordinator role also includes ensuring teams have adequate orientation and information about the rules. A document covering this for the 2017 competition can be found [here](./process-docs/pit-rules.md).**
