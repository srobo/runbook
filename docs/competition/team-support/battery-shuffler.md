# Battery Shuffler

A battery shuffler is a volunteer that moves batteries, battery chargers, battery charger PSUs and battery charging bags from reception to the battery charging station on Saturday morning.

## Saturday Morning Shuffling

Teams arrive on Saturday morning between 9:00 and 9:30. When they arrive we take the following items off of them at the arrival desk:

* 1x Battery
* 1x Battery charger
* 1x Battery charger power supply
* 1x Battery charging bag

All of these parts need to be carried from the arrival desk to the battery charging station where they will be used by us to manage the charging of batteries.

The reception desk will be taking batteries/chargers/bags from teams as they arrive, as we don't allow teams to charge their own batteries. The Battery Shuffler needs to continually carry these items to the battery charging station. They must repeat this until most teams have arrived.
