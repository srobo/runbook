# Tinker Time

Tinker Time is time allocated in the schedule to allow teams to test their robot in the actual arena.

Each 'slot' is usually 10 minutes, depending on how much time is scheduled and how many teams are expected. For each slot, team may book a single corner (without preference). Teams should be considerate of other teams and robots in the arena, using the space around the arena to watch rather than all trying to be in the arena at once. Shepherds will not be used to fetch teams for tinker time slot - they will need to remember.

After their slot has elapsed, the team should vacate the arena (even if there isn't another team to replace them). Depending on the number of available slots, teams may be prevented from booking multiple slots.

Tinker time can be booked at either [Helpdesk](./helpdesk.md) or Staging. Teams are free to cancel or postpone their slots as necessary, however they may risk losing their chance to test.

Robots must be Safety checked (denoted by a high-vis) before they can enter the arena for Tinker Time, however do not necessarily need to pass the Regulations check. Teams which have not had a Safety check yet should be sent to helpdesk.

Unless otherwise authorised by the Event Director, Tinker Time will not run during Lunch.

## Test Arena

The Test Arena is an arena which is open throughout the event for testing, rather than during scheduled times.

The Test Arena 'slots' are usually 15 minutes - longer than regular Tinker Time. If, after 15 minutes, there are no teams waiting, the team may continue testing. If a new team turns up, the team who has been in the longest should be swapped out.

Slots are booked at the arena, rather than helpdesk. Whilst there is no formal form for scheduling, however it's recommended to track the team's TLA and start time to easily see who is to be replaced. A whiteboard is best for this.

Robots must still be Safety checked to use the test arena.
