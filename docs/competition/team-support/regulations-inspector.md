# Regulations Inspector

Before any robot may compete in a match, it must be inspected to ensure that it complies with the game rules. Regulations checks are performed by volunteers visiting a team in their pit. Teams with earlier matches should be checked firstThe Robot Regulations Checklist ([example][robot-regulations-checklist]) should be used to inspect a robot.

!!! warning
    A team should not be regulations checked until they have passed a safety check. If a team has not yet passed a safety check, suggest they contact helpdesk immediately.

Once a team has passed a regulations inspection, they should be given a hi-viz. This is used by staging to confirm they have passed.

In some cases, a team may change their robot such that it is no longer safe or complies with the regulations. In this case, confiscate their hi-viz until they pass. If a robot is no longer safe, additionally confiscate their battery.
