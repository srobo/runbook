# Competition Team Support Documentation

This is the Competition Team Support Coordinator's documentation. The Competition Team Support Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that teams are supported, with technical problems, throughout the competition. The Competition Team Support team consists of four roles:

* [Helpdesk](./helpdesk.md) Volunteers
* [Battery Shuffler](./battery-shuffler.md)
* [Roving Helper](./roving-helper.md)

These roles will be filled by various people throughout the competition. All volunteers filling these roles report to the Competition Team Support Coordinator and may not create subordinate roles.

## Helpdesk

The main source of support for teams is Helpdesk. Helpdesk is always manned by at least two volunteers and ideally three volunteers. There should always be at least one volunteer who has experience with the SR kit on Helpdesk at any point in time. Further details can be found in the [Helpdesk](./helpdesk.md) docs.

## Battery Shufflers

When teams arrive at the competition we take their batteries, chargers and battery bags off of them at the arrival desk. These parts need ferrying from the arrival desk to the battery charging station. Also, at the end of the competition, teams that have a loan extension approval will need to be given batteries, a charger and a battery bag before they leave. These parts need ferrying from the battery charging station to the kit return desk. Further details can be found in the [Battery Shuffler](./battery-shuffler.md) docs. One person is required to shuffle batteries/chargers on Saturday morning and one person is required to shuffle them on Sunday afternoon.

## Roving Helpers

Teams will always have quick questions about the kit, the game and the competition in general. Most of these questions can be handled by volunteers on the spot. To help deal with these questions quickly and efficiently there should be volunteers, known as Roving Helpers, wandering around the pits. There should be as many Roving Helpers as possible throughout the competition, but there is no minimum number. Further details can be found in the [Roving Helper](./roving-helper.md) docs.
