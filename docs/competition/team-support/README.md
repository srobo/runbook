# Team Support

During the competition, teams will need support for various aspects of the event. Helpdesk is the first point of call for these issues, although it may not be helpdesk directly who resolve the issue.

The Helpdesk team consists of four main roles:

* [Head of Helpdesk](#head-of-helpdesk) ("Head Helpdesker")
* [Helpdesk](#helpdesker) Volunteers ("Helpdesker")
* [Battery Charging](./battery-charging.md)
* [Roving Helper](./roving-helper.md)

These roles will be filled by various people throughout the competition. Because of its nature, these roles require a knowledge of the [kit](../../kit/README.md) and event.
