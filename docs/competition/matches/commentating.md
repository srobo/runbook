# Commentating

Commentators are responsible for commentating matches and building the excitement of those near the arena.

You will be given a microphone to be heard over the noise of the arena. The microphone will usually only be heard in the arena, rather than across the entire venue.

!!! tip
    Commentating is a very mentally-intensive task. In between matches, be sure to rest and have a drink. If you need a longer break during a match, just flag it to your co-commentator or head shepherd.

As an example of previous commentary, the [SR2024 grand final](https://www.youtube.com/live/CpCC2fTn0os?t=20885s).

## Tips for commentators

These tips are based on previous experiences, and should not necessarily be considered rules.

### Livestream

For in-person events, there will likely be a separate [livestream](../../programme/livestream/README.md) host team, handling talking to viewers during the breaks between matches. There's no need to do an explicit hand-over.

### Lead-ins

Use the 20 seconds before a match to introduce the teams in each corner.  This gives you enough time to introduce teams without rushing, but also a fixed time for the livestream team to cut over. Talking before 20 seconds may not go out to the livestream.

From 5 seconds, count down to the start of the match. This not only builds atmosphere, but also ensures the marshals start robots at the right time, without needing to watch the clocks on the screen.

For the semi and grand final(s), introduce the match with 1 minute to go, to allow for a longer lead time to introduce each team and get a round of applause for each. For the grand final, have the audience help with counting down from 10 to build atmosphere.

### Closing

When a match ends, a countdown helps marshals award points based on where the robot is exactly when the clock strikes 0. Keep an eye on the clock as the match ends, so the match doesn't finish mid-sentence, catching you off-guard.

For the grand final, much like the lead-in, have the audience help with counting down from 10.

When closing off a match, congratulate all the teams on their performances. Once a match has ended, try and keep commentary short and wrap up promptly. Once you've finished talking, don't chime in with something additional, as the livestream team may have already cut over.

### Rules

Before commentating, it's a good idea to have read the rules for the game, particularly to understand how points are scored and specific definitions (for example when a token is in a zone). When commentating on an action, knowing whether it scores points is a useful piece of detail.

It's important to not imply that what the commentator says is what is scored. The marshals are responsible for how the match is scored.

Try and avoid explicitly saying which team won a match, and exactly how many points a team has. Even when it's it's obvious, you may be wrong. This is particularly important in the semi or grand finals to keep suspense for the prize-giving. Using relative points, such as saying an action is worth `n` points is useful to show when points are scored, and emphasise the good performance of a team.

### Arena

Keep an eye on the entire arena, rather than focusing on a single robot or area. This ensures that all robots are commentated on, rather than just the robot(s) performing well.

As commentators, feel free to move around the arena as needed, to get a better view of what's going on, and avoid standing in one place. When doing this, ensure you're not obstructing the view of a particularly-engaged team or more importantly a marshal.

### Team interviews

Depending on their engagement, you may want to ask a team or competitor for their input. For example whether their robot is meant to move like that, or why they went with that strategy.

To avoid walking over and handing them the mic, you can repeat what they say yourself if you can hear them.

If they don't answer right away, move on, to avoid pressuring them or creating dead-air in the commentary.

### Teams

A team may be identified by their TLA, Team name or institution name. Being able to identify a team based on their TLA and robot is handy for quickly referencing a team, especially during countdowns where you may only be looking at a single screen of TLAs.

Teams may not be aware they can set a Team name. If they wish to do this, it can be done at [helpdesk](../team-support/helpdesk.md).

### Knockout leavers

During the knockouts, teams play their final match. In between knockout rounds, score entry can provide the list of teams not progressing through that round. It's recommended to bring attention to them, say goodbye to them and congratulate them on their performance.

## Multiple commentators

It's likely that multiple people will commentate a given match. This allows one person to fill in the gaps, or to create entertaining "banter" between the commentators.

Before you start, it's a good idea to chat with whoever you're going to be commentating with, to get an idea for their experience level, confidence, and how they like to work. The better you work together, the better your commentary will be.

It's important to avoid talking over each other, therefore it's advisable to work out a pattern for how you're going to commentate a match. Some examples might be:

### Colour + play-by-play

The "play-by-play" commentator handles commentating things as they happen, such as robots moving and points being scored.

The "colour" commentator discusses the bigger picture, such as whether the robots have faced before, how this match fits into the rest of the competition, and larger patterns of the competition so far.

If something "interesting" happens in a match, it's important that the "colour" commentator let the "play-by-play" commentator speak. Ideally by wrapping up quickly and handing over, but potentially by stopping mid-sentence.

### Primary + secondary

The "primary" commentator is the one who does the majority of the talking for a match.

The "secondary" commentator is there for support. Being additional eyes in the arena, another voice to converse with, and filling in gaps so the primary commentator can watch the match to see what to talk about next. Keep an eye on the primary commentator for when they may be about to start talking.

If something "interesting" happens in a match, the "primary" commentator should be the one to lead on talking about it. If the secondary commentator is the one to notice it, or is talking as it happens, a clean transition can help shift the audience's attention.

It's best to take it in turns for being the primary commentator, perhaps by doing an odd/even split on matches.

!!! note
    These are just examples. You can invent your own methods, or use a combination.
