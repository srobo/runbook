# Virtual Competitions

Due to COVID-19 Student Robotics has held the competition for the SR2020 and SR2021 competition cycles online.

[A 3D simulator][simulator] has been developed that can be distributed to competitors so they can program their virtual robot. Teams then [submit their code][code_submitter] to us and we [broadcast][livestream] the matches.
