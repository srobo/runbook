# Competition Setup Roles

There are specific roles which are needed for the setup phase of a competition. One role may be filled by multiple volunteers, and one volunteer may be filling multiple roles. Some roles should only be assigned to a single volunteer, and this be their only role.

Depending on the nature of the event, some of these roles may not be applicable.
